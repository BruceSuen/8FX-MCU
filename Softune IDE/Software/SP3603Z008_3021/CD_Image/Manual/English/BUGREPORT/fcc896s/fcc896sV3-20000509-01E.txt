[Status]          Completely fixed
[Tool Name]       SOFTUNE C Compiler
[Versions]        V30L03
[Date]            2000-05-09
[Host]            PC-AT
[OS]              Windows NT4.0/98/95
[Revision]        V30L04
[Severity]        Middle

[Outline]
        The address of the member of the I/O register file is wrong.

[Detail]
        When the I/O register file attached to V30L03 is used, the address of
        SMC22 register and SRC2 register of UART/SIO of the MB89530 series is
        different from the CPU.

        [Conditions]
            (1) Include the I/O register file "_ffmc8l.h" which attached to
                V30L03. AND,
            (2) The following MB numbers are specified for -cpu option. AND,
                    MB89530   MB89537   MB89537C  MB89537H
                    MB89537HC MB89538   MB89P538  MB89538C
                    MB89538H  MB89538HC MB89PV530
            (3) Use the following I/O registers.
                    IO_SRC2
                    IO_SMC22

        [C source]
            #include "_ffmc8l.h"
            main()
            {
              IO_SRC2 = 0;
              IO_SMC22.byte = 0;
            }

        [Linker Map File]
            00000033(ABS)      Addr.  OM/LM @_IO_SMC22     ;; CPU is 0x30.
            00000030(ABS)      Addr.  OM/LM @_IO_SRC2      ;; CPU is 0x33.

[Workaround]
      - Please use correction version (V30L04 or later).
