[Severity]        High

[Outline]
        The act_cyc() of REALOS System Call function is not correctly
        inline-expanded.

[Detail]
        When the same constant as the 1st argument and the 2nd argument of
        the act_cyc() is described, the inline-expansion of the act_cyc() is
        not correct.

        [Conditions]
            (1) Specified the -Krealos option. AND,
            (2) Used the ret_int() of REALOS System Call function which the
                same constant as the 1st argument and the 2nd argument of the
                act_cyc() is described.

        [C source]
            f(){
              act_cyc(1,1);
            }

        [ASM output(wrong)]
            _f:
                    MOVW    A, #1
                    CALL    act_cyc
            L_f:
                    RET

        [ASM output(correct)]
            _f:
                    MOVW    A, #1
                    MOVW    A, #1
                    XCHW    A, T
                    CALL    act_cyc
            L_f:
                    RET

[Workaround]
      - Please modify the 1st argument or the 2nd argument to variable.
