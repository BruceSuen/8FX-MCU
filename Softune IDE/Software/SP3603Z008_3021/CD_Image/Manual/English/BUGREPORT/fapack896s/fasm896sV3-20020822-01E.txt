[Outline]
        After completion of assembly, the temporary file that was made by the
        assembler may be left.

[Detail]
        The preprocessor processing by the assembler makes the temporary file in
        the following directory:

        [Temporary file name]
           asm.*   (*: An arbitrary character string that was created by the
                       assembler)
        [Directory]
           When the environment variable TMP is set:
                     Directory that is set for the environment variable TMP
           When the environment variable TMP is not set:  /tmp

           A setting example of the environment variable TMP
                         % setenv TMP /home/tmp

        Normally, this temporary file is deleted, but when the following condition
        1 or 2 is met, it is not deleted and is left.

          1. When the #macro instruction and the #repeat instruction are not
             written
          2. When a macro definition is provided using the #macro instruction,
             but the macro call instruction for the macro is not present; and
             the #repeat instruction is not written

        [When the temporary file is left  -  Example 1]
          /* the #macro instruction and the #repeat instruction are not written */

        [When the temporary file is left  -  Example 2]
           #macro  mac     addr_1,addr_2
                MOVW     A, #addr_1
                MOVW     A, #addr_2
           #endm
                /* the macro call instruction for the macro mac is not present */
                /* and the #repeat instruction is not written */

[Workaround]
        Delete the temporary file.
