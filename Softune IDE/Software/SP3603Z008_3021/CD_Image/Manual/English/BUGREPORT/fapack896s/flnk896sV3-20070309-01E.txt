[Detail]
        When there are a large number of modules referring to an external
        symbol, the linker may be terminated abnormally, if the external symbol
        cross-reference information list is created.

        --- Symbol --     --- type/value ---    --- modlue (No.) ---

                                               |                    |
                                               +--------------------+
                                                         ^
                                        It happens when this part of module
                                        number string exceeds 1025 bytes.

        The creation of the external symbol cross-reference information list
        will be performed after the creation of load module (ABS) file is
        terminated normally.
        Therefore, load module file (ABS) can be created correctly even if this
        problem occurs.

[Workaround]
        Please inhibit the external symbol cross-reference information list
        output by either one of the methods below.
        A. Inhibiting by Workbench
          1. Select a tub for [Linker] in [Setup Project].
          2. Select [Output List] category.
          3. Remove check for [Creates a external symbol mutual reference
             information list].

        B. Inhibiting by command line.
          Delete the specification of external symbol cross-reference
          information list output option (-xl), or add the external symbol
          cross-reference information list output inhibiting option (-Xxl)
          after -xl option specification.
