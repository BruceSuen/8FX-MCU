[Outline]
        The assembly time might become remarkably long.

[Detail]
        The assembly time becomes remarkably long if the assembler source with
        a lot of lines is assembled when assembly list output option is
        specified.
        The number of lines at this time contain lines of the file that is
        included. 

[Workaround]
        Please suppress output assembly list.
        There are the following two methods of the assembly list output
        suppression.
         - Please delete specification of assembly list option (-l) and
           specification of output assembly list file name option (-lf).
         - Please add suppression of output assembly list option (-Xl) after -l
           option and -lf option.
