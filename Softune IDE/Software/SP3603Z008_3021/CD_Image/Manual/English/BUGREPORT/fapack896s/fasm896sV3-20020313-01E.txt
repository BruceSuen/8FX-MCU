[Outline]
        When assembling a source file beginning with a numeric character,
        a fatal error occurs depending on the way of specifying the option
        to set the output level of warning message.

[Detail]
        When assembling a source file (example:  0123.asm) beginning with
        a numeric character, a fatal error occurs depending on the way of
        specifying the option (-w [0 to 3]) to set the output level of
        warning message.

        (1) A fatal error occurs when:
            the w option's warning level is omitted; that is, '-w' is
            immediately followed by a source file beginning with a numeric
            character.

                C:\>fasm896s -cpu mb89603 -w 0123.asm
                *** F9954A: Invalid value (-w 0123.asm)
                *** F9951A: Source filename not specified
                C:\>

        (2) No fatal error occurs when:
            the w option's warning level is not omitted; that is, '-w' is
            immediately followed by a warning level.

                C:\>fasm896s -cpu mb89603 -w 2 0123.asm
                C:\>

[Workaround]
        Specify the warning level.
