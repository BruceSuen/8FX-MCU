[Outline]
        Linker aborts when "-sl" is specified.

[Detail]
        The linker aborts if you set the option "-sl" when linking in sources
        in which functions returning function pointers as recovery values and
        functions making function pointers into arguments are described.

[Workaround]
        There is no method for avoidance.
        Do not use that include "-sl" option.

[Note]
        Changing the display format of local symbol list
          The display by only the static symbol value replaced the display by
          the auto-valuable.
