[Status]        Completely fixed
[Tool Name]     SOFTUNE Assembler Pack (assembler)
[Versions]      V30L07-V30L08

[Severity]      Middle

[Outline]
        The line number displayed by the following messages swerves ahead one
        line when assembler code is described in C source.
          - E4616A : Not enough operands
          - W1712A : This structure field cannot initialized

[Detail]
        The line number displayed by the following messages swerves ahead one
        line when assembler code is described in C source.
          - E4616A : Not enough operands
          - W1712A : This structure field cannot initialized

        At this time, the error jump function of Workbench cannot correctly
        display the line with the invalid description.

        The following is an example of the description causing the error.

        - E4616A : Not enough operands
          line number | C source description
          ------------+--------------------------------------------------------
               1      |func()
               2      |{
               3      |#pragma asm     <== Line displayed by error jump
                      |                    function of Workbench
               4      |    MOV  A      <== Invalid description
               5      |#pragma endasm
               6      |}

        When the above C source is compiled with debug information, the
        following error message is displayed.

        *** sample.c(3) E4616A: Not enough operands

        - W1712A : This structure field cannot initialized
          line number | C source description
          ------------+--------------------------------------------------------
               1      |func()
               2      |{
               3      |#pragma asm
               4      |TAG:   .STRUCT
               5      |MEM1:  .DATA.B  0,0
               6      |MEM2:  .RES.B   1
               7      |MEM3:  .DATA.B  1,1
               8      |TAG:   .ENDS       <== Line displayed by error jump
                      |                       function of Workbench
               9      |c:     TAG <1,1,1> <== Invalid description
              10      |#pragma endasm
              11      |}

        When the above C source is compiled with debug information, the
        following error message is displayed.

        *** sample.c(3) W1712A: This structure field cannot initialized

[Workaround]
        Please refer after one line of the line number displayed in the
        message.
