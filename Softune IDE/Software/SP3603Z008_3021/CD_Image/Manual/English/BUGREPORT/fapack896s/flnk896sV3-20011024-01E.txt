[Outline]
        When an absolute assemble list is created for the list in which
        assembler pseudo-instructions causing the bit locations ; such as
        .bit, .data.i, .datab.i and .res.i ; are used, the error (E4335L)
        occurs.

[Detail]
        When an absolute assemble list is created for the list in which
        assembler pseudo-instructions causing the bit locations ; such as
        .bit, .data.i, .datab.i and .res.i ; are used, the internal address
        counter is miscalculated. And then the error (E4335L) occurs.
        This error occurs in the following sources.

                .DATA.I 1
                .DATA.I 1
                .DATA.B 0x12,0x34
                .DATA.B 0x56,0x78

[Workaround]
        Use the byte-by-byte assembler pseudo-instructions such as .data.b
        instead of the bit-by-bit assembler pseudo-instructions.

        Example:
                .DATA.I 1
                .DATA.I 1       ->      .data.b  b'00000011
