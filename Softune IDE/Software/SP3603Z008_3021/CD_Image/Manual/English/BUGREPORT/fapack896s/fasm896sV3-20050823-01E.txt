[Severity]      High

[Outline]
        The error (E4550A:Location counter overflow) occurs even though the
        section size does not exceed the upper limit value. 

[Detail]
        The upper limit value of one section size on the F2MC-8L/8FX Assemblers
        is 64KB. 
        If the section size exceeded the upper limit value, the error (E4550A:
        Location counter overflow) occurs. 
        When it occurs, an object file is not output. 
        However, if the -l option is specified, an assembly list is output. 

        The error occurs (E4550A:Location counter overflow) even though the
        section size does not exceed the upper limit value, if a branch
        assembler pseudo-machine instruction or a structured instructions such
        as an ".if" statement is described in the section. 
        The following are the conditions for this problem and how to determine
        this problem has occurred.

        [Conditions for Problem] 
           - Branch assembler pseudo-machine instruction or a structured
             instruction is described in the section. 
           - Section size exceeds the upper limit value of when all branch
             assembler pseudo-machine instructions or structured instructions
             in the section are an absolute branching code (a long code). 

        [How to Determine Problem Has Occurred]
           The correct section size is output to the assembly list.
           If an error occurs although the section size output to the list file
           does not exceed the upper limit value (64KB), it means the problem
           has occurred. 

[Workaround]
        Split the source where the error occurred into multiple sources.
