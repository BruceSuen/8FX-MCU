[Outline]
        The absolute assemble list is not created correctly.

[Detail]
        If the section with the section name matching the section name as
        compared in the character length strncmp exists in the same module,
        the absolute assemble list is not created correctly.

        This problem occurs in the following source:

                .SECTION        CODE2, CODE, ALIGN=1
                MOVW            A, _addr
                PUSHW           A
                CALL            _func
                        .
                        .
                        .

                .SECTION        CODE, CODE, ALIGN=1
                MOVW            A, _addr
                PUSHW           A
                CALL            _func
                        .
                        .
                        .

        In the above source, the section name CODE matches the section name
        CODE2 in the character length (4 characters).
        This problem will not affect the load module to be generated.

[Workaround]
        Change the first character of a section name to avoid duplicating
        names.
