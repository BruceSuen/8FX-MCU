[Severity]      High

[Outline]
        Message files cannot be opened when kanji characters are included in
        Environment Variable "FETOOL".

[Detail]
        When Environment Variable "FETOOL" includes kanji characters and a
        character of 0x5c(\) in the second byte, or when the load module
        converter displays version information (specifying the -V option),
        simple help (specifying the -help option), the message file cannot be
        opened and the error message (***F9998U: Can not open file (message
        file)) is displayed.
        This problem does not occur on the load module converter in the version
        V30L05.

        This problem occurs in the Japanese version of the Windows system.

[Workaround]
        Use an Environment Variable "FETOOL" that does not include kanji
        characters.
        Use the load module converter in the version V30L05.
