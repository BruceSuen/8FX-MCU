[Outline]
        When the section content/type in the section details map list is
        "DIRCONST", the character string "DIRCONST" that indicates the
        section type is overwritten in characters indicating the joint
        attributes and output.
        Also, in this case, a continuous character string that does not
        include empty spaces <space fonts> (delimiter) is output.

[Detail]
        When the section content/type in the section details map list is
        "DIRCONST", the character string "DIRCONST" that indicates the
        section type is overwritten in characters (P/C/N) indicating the
        joint attributes, as shown in the example below, and output.
        Also, in this case, the character string "DIRCONST" indicating the
        section type is displayed up to the position where the empty
        characters that separate the section contents (called Section in
        the example below) and the section type (called Type in the example
        below), so the section content and section type are output as a
        continuous character string.

        S_Addr. -E_Addr.   Size     Section Type Al M.No.  Sec.(Top 80)
        00000000-00000000  00000001 DIRCONPTR--I 01    1   DIRCONST_2
        00000010-00000010  00000001 DIRCONNTR--I 00    1   DIRCONST_1

[Workaround]
        Use the modified version of the linker.
