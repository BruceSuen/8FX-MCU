[Outline]
        When the "alr" option is specified, the linker may be terminated
        abnormally.

[Detail]
        When the "alr" option is specified at link time, and the count of
        debug information symbols exceed 65535, the linker may be terminated
        abnormally.

[Workaround]
        At compiling or assembling time, do not specify the debug information
        output option "-g" for the module that is not debugged and set the
