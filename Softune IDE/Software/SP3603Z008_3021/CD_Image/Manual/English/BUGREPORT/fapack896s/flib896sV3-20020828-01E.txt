[Severity]      High

[Outline]
        Error occurs when the size of an object file to be added to the
        library is a multiple of 30,000 bytes + 4 bytes.

[Detail]
        A file write error (F9017) occurs when the size of an object file to
        be added to the library is a multiple of 30,000 bytes + 4 bytes.
        With Windows, check the size with [File] - [Property] or with the
        "DIR" command at the command level prompt.
        With workstations, check the size with the "ls-1" command.

[Workaround]
        Check the size of an object file to be added to the library so that it
        does not become a multiple of 30,000 bytes + 4 bytes.
