[Severity]      Middle

[Outline]
        Does not operate normally when only the path name is described at the
        -o and -lf options.

[Detail]
        When starting the assembler specifying only the path name where a file
        name, such as
            D:\aaa> fasm896s D:\aaa\test.asm -cpu MB89603 -o d:\
        should be specified from the command line, will cause it to make files
        with illegal file names such as
            d:\D:\aaa\test.obj
        and subsequently to fail.

[Workaround]
        Specify without omitting the file name.

        [Example]
             D:\aaa> fasm896s D:\aaa\test.asm -cpu MB89603 -o d:\test.obj
             D:\aaa> fasm896s D:\aaa\test.asm -cpu MB89603 -o d:\test
