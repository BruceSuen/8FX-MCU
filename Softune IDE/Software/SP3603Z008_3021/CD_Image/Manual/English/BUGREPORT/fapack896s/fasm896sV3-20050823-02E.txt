[Status]        Completely fixed
[Tool Name]     SOFTUNE Assembler Pack (assembler)
[Versions]      V30L01-V30L08

[Host]          PC-AT | Sun4 | HP-9000
[OS]            Windows XP/Me/2000/98/NT4.0 | Solaris 2.6 | HP-UX 10.0
[Revision]      V30L09
[Severity]      Low

[Outline]
        The warning (W1558A:Starting address not in code section) occurs
        although a section of the starting address specified by the .END pseudo
        instruction indicates the CODE attribute section.

[Detail]
        If the following description is made as the .END pseudo instruction,
        the starting address of program can be specified. 

        	.END	[Start address]

        If the starting address has not specified the CODE attribute section,
        the warning (W1558A:Starting address not in code section) occurs. 
        Even if the warning occurs, the starting address specified by .END is
        set as it is. 

        When all of the conditions below are met, the warning (W1558A) occurs
        although the starting address indicates the CODE attribute section. 

          - Absolute section of the CODE attribute and absolute section other
            than the CODE attribute exist. 
          - The end address of the absolute section other than the CODE
            attribute and the beginning address of the absolute section of the
            CODE attribute are the same address. 
          - In the Assembler source program, an absolute section other than
            the CODE attribute is described before the CODE attribute absolute
            section. 
          - The starting address indicates the beginning of the absolute
            section of the CODE attribute. 

        The following is an example of the source description where the
        problem occurs. 

            .SECTION  CONST, CONST, LOCATE=0xFF0
            .DATA.W   0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
            .SECTION  CODE, CODE, LOCATE=0x1000
        _START:
            NOP
            NOP
            .END      _START  <== The starting address indicates a beginning
                                  of the CODE section.

[Workaround]
        Change the absolute section of the CODE attribute to a relative
        section.
