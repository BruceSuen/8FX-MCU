[Severity]      High

[Outline]
        An error object with an incorrect branch is output if the relative
        distance between the branch instruction and the branch destination
        address is outside of the operand size range. 

[Detail]
        If the relative distance between the branch instruction and the branch
        destination address is outside of the operand size range, and the -OVFW
        option is specified, the Assembler issues the warning (W1541A: Value
        out of range), outputs an object file and terminates. 
        The relative distance between the branch instruction and the branch
        destination address in which there was the warning (W1541A: Value out
        of range) is masked according to the operand size. 
        In this case, the output object file is an error one with an incorrect
        branch. Never use this to make a load module file or a library file. 

        -OVFW is an option for a warning message when the operand operation
        result exceeds the operand size. 
        If -OVFW is not specified, the Assembler issues the error (E4541A:
        Value out of range), and it does not output an object file and
        terminates. 

[Workaround]
        - Change the branch instruction so that the relative distance between
          the branch instruction and the branch destination address is within
          the operand size range for the branch instruction in which the
          warning (W1541A) was output. 
        - Disable the -OVFW specification to prevent outputting error object
          files with incorrect branches.
