[Outline]
        When "-V" and "-XV" are included in the library file name or the

        version number display, and an option for inhibiting version number
        display respectively.

[Detail]
        When "-V" and "-XV" are included in the library file name or the
        object file name, the "-V" and "-XV" are recognized as an option for
        version number display, and an option for inhibiting version number
        display respectively.

        1. When "-V" is included in the file name, the version number is
           displayed.
          [Example]
             flib896s libfile-V.lib ...     <- Version number is displayed.
                                               (Default version number display
                                               inhibition)
             flib896s -XV libfile-V.lib ... <- The version number is displayed
                                               in spite of specifying the
                                               version number display
                                               inhibition.

        2. When "-XV" is included in the file name, the version number is not
           displayed.
          [Example]
             flib896s -V libfile-XV.lib ... <- The version number is not
                                               displayed in spite of
                                               specifying the version number
                                               display.

[Workaround]
        Do not use file names that include "-V" or "-XV".
