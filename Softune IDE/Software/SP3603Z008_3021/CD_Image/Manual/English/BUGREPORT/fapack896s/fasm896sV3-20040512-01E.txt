[Outline]
        If an error occurs during assembling, the line number of the error
        message may be displayed incorrectly.

[Detail]
        If an error occurs during assembling, the line number of the error
        message may be displayed incorrectly.
        This error occurs when the assemble source with debug information
        output by the Compiler is assembled.
        If the error occurs, the line number of the error message is displayed
        incorrectly and the error jump function of Workbench cannot correctly
        display the line with the invalid description.
        This problem will not affect the object code to be output.
        The following is an example of the description causing the error.

        [Example of description causing problem]
        line number | C source description
        ------------+---------------------------------------------------------
             1      |func()
             2      |{
             3      |#pragma asm
             4      |    AA          <== Invalid description
             5      |#pragma endasm  <== Line displayed by error jump function
             6      |}                   of Workbench

        When the above C source is compiled with debug information, the
        following error message is displayed.

        *** test.c(5) E4600A: Invalid operation mnemonic (AA)

        The invalid description is on the 4th line, but is displayed on the 5th
        line of the error message.
        The error jump function of Workbench displays the 5th line.


[Workaround]
        Use the modified version of the assembler.
