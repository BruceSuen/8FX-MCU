[Outline]
        When a preprocessor instruction contains a hexadecimal constant that
        begins with "0D" and has the suffix "H", a warning message (W1116A)
        is output.

[Detail]
        When a preprocessor instruction contains a hexadecimal constant that
        begins with "0D" and has the suffix "H", "0D" is misidentified as
        the prefix for the decimal constant, outputting a warning message
        (W1116A).

        [An example of a hexadecimal constant notation for which the warning
        message is output]
               #define DEF_VAL 0D0H

        [Warning message to be output]
               W1116A:  Invalid value (0D0H)
               W1116A:  Invalid value (0D0H)

[Workaround]
        When writing a hexadecimal constant, omit "0" at the beginning of it
        or use the prefix "0x".

        [An example of a hexadecimal constant notation when "0" at the
        beginning is omitted]
               #define DEF_VAL D0H

        [An example of a hexadecimal constant notation when the prefix "0x" is
        used]
               #define DEF_VAL 0x0D0
